About Dataset

This data originally came from Crowdflower's Data for Everyone library.

As the original source says,

    A sentiment analysis job about the problems of each major U.S. airline. Twitter data was scraped from February of 2015 and contributors were asked 
to first classify positive, negative, and neutral tweets, followed by categorizing negative reasons (such as "late flight" or "rude service").

The data we're providing on Kaggle is a slightly reformatted version of the original source. It includes both a CSV file and SQLite database. The code 
that does these transformations is available on GitHub
